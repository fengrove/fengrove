It is far from production ready at this point. But please check it out if you want!

## ðŸš€ Installation

Download the executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/swamp/fengrove/releases)

### MacOS

Please install using homebrew if at all possible:

- Add the tap: (this is only needed once)

```sh
brew tap fengrove/tap
brew update
```

- Install fengrove

```sh
brew install fengrove
```

#### Using the tar file

Due to Apple's security measures, you'll need to allow the executable:

```sh
xattr -cr ./fengrove
```
